Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle
1.	Add a statement that declares a double variable for width and initialize it to a value of 4.25.
2.	Add a statement that declares a double variable for length and initialize it to a value of 8.5.
3.	Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle that has the width and length set in the previous two steps. 
To do that, you can use this formula:
perimeter = 2 * width + 2 * length
4.	Print the values for the width, length, and perimeter to the console like this:
Width:     4.25
Length:    8.5
Perimeter: 25.5

Print the values for the area as well.
